## Here are some coding projects I've worked on

- Created a game on Unity from scratch. It plays similar to Minesweeper but it's only a 5x5 grid and it tells you how many bombs are in each row and column.
  - I also created the above game in Swift, but lost all the data due to transfer from a Mac to PC.
- All projects from the class EECS 281 - Data Structures and Algorithms
- All projects from the class EECS 280 - Programming and Intro Data Structures
- All projects from the class EECS 101 - Introduction to Computers and Programming

### Other fun projects I've worked on

- Drew illustrations for the book Attachment-Based Yoga & Meditation by Deidre Fay.
- Created a logo for a restaurant in Cambridge, MA, called Sakana.

Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
