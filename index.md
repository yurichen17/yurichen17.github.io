### Here are some coding projects I've worked on

-   Created a game on Unity from scratch. It plays similar to Minesweeper but it's only a 5x5 grid and it tells you how many bombs are in each row and column.
  - I also created the above game in Swift, but lost all the data due to transfer from a Mac to PC.
-   All projects from the class EECS 281 - Data Structures and Algorithms
-   All projects from the class EECS 280 - Programming and Intro Data Structures
-   All projects from the class EECS 101 - Introduction to Computers and Programming

### Definition lists can be used with HTML syntax.

```
Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
