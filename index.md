# Welcome to my website! My name is Yuri Chen.

I'm currently a sophmore at University of Michigan for Computer Science. I am also pursuing a minor in Art and Design. My hobbies are doing jigsaw puzzles, knitting, video game design, art, and running.

### Clubs I'm in!
- UM Autonomous Robotic Vehicle 
  - I'm on the computer vision subteam, and as of now, we are creating side projects in replacement of the competition that occurs yearly called the Intelligent Ground Vehicle Competition. Right now, I'm in the process of making an autonomous remote controlled car by implementing computer vision tactics. 
- UMich Esports 
  - I am the manager of the University of Michigan League of Legends C Team, so I plan practices and meets with other schools. I have also initiated and set up multiple community events to simulate engagement within the large community of 40+ people that like League of Legends at Umich.

### Classes I'm taking currently this semester at the University of Michigan
- EECS 370 - Intro to Computer Organization
- EECS 442 - Computer Vision (one of my favorite classes so far!)
- ARTDES 125 - Studio 4D
- ARTDES 105 - Drawing Visualization 

## Projects
[Click here to get a more in depth look at my projects](artworkPage.md)

### Here are some coding projects I've worked on 

- Created a game on Unity from scratch. It plays similar to Minesweeper but it's only a 5x5 grid and it tells you how many bombs are in each row and column.
  - I also created the above game in Swift, but lost all the data due to transfer from a Mac to PC.
- All projects from the class EECS 281 - Data Structures and Algorithms
- All projects from the class EECS 280 - Programming and Intro Data Structures
- All projects from the class EECS 101 - Introduction to Computers and Programming

### Other fun projects I've worked on 

- Researched under the Undergraduate Research Opportunity Program (UROP) in the Zopf Lab at the University of Michigan
 - I was tasked to create a surgical simulation by making a skull through a biomedial CAD program. <a href="https://github.com/yurichen17/yurichen17.github.io/blob/main/updated%20urop%20poster%202020%20(1).pdf" download="UROP-Yuri_Chen">Check out my research poster!</a>
- Drew illustrations for the book _Attachment-Based Yoga & Meditation_ by Deidre Fay.
- Created a logo for a restaurant in Cambridge, MA called Sakana.

Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
